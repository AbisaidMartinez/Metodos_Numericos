# Numerical Analysis Algorithms

This repository contains scripts and implementations of classical numerical analysis algorithms developed during my Bachelor and Master studies.  
The main objective is to build a deep understanding of fundamental root-finding and approximation methods through clear, reproducible code.

## 📌 Contents
- **Root-finding methods**
  - Newton–Raphson
  - Secant method
  - False Position (Regula Falsi)
  - Bisection 
- **Supporting utilities**
  - Error tracking
  - Convergence visualization

## 🎯 Objectives
- Strengthen theoretical knowledge of numerical methods.
- Provide practical, well-documented implementations in Python.
- Compare convergence speed and accuracy across different algorithms.

## 🚀 Usage
Clone the repository and run the scripts with Python 3:
